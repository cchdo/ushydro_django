[{"post":{"excerpt":"<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p><p>Greetings from Antarctica! Our team traveled from our homes first to Christchurch, New Zealand, where we assembled and enjoyed the sunny weather and green gardens before our trip south. We had been told ahead to pack a \"boomerang bag\" which we would take with us if our flight to Antarctica was turned back en route by fast-changing Antarctic weather, because we would not get all our luggage back until we finally made it to Antarctica. (We found out that the record for consecutive boomerangs was seven!) We had also been told that certain items were required in our carry on bags, which had to fit under our seats. We thought these were one in the same so were quite relieved to be told during the pre-flight briefing the day before our flight that the boomerang bag was just one of our checked bags.</p>","post":"app/views/blog/_20110217_letter.html.erb","latitude":-77.85,"post_type":"letter","post_date":"2011-02-17","longitude":166.6667,"received_dt":"2011-02-16T13:24:00-08:00"}},{"post":{"excerpt":"<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p><p style=\"color:#99f;font-style:italic\">Administrative material has been redacted for brevity.</p><p>Most things are going well, with a few exceptions (more or less as usual).

Big low pressure systems (storms) develop and evolve to circulate around Antarctica in a steady parade. Our mote in the ocean - the Nathaniel B. Palmer - has been hit three times so far by storms with winds well over 40 knots (equals 46 statute miles/hour), plus the ship is always affected by swell (sometimes quite large) propagating from distant storms.

The captain and mates choose a heading and slow speed that will provide a reasonably good ride, and try to judge when to head back to the next station just in time for the seas to have improved post-storm to the point where we can go back to work.

The entire ship&#39;s company carried this out with their usual expertise, efficiency, and good cheer. We have all enjoyed the good weather and lack of equipment problems. The last group of 5 closely-spaced stations were carried out in highly varied and increasingly more impressive ice ranging from the smallest newly-formed frazil ice that \"greases\" the sea surface, to new \"pancake ice\" of various sizes (very easy going), to first (easy) and multi-year (hard) sea ice, to impressively thick pieces of broken off ice shelf (impossible), to mighty icebergs (likewise). The Palmer&#39;s mates and our expert ice pilot Vladimir Repin enjoy the challenge of guiding the ship through the maze of ice - they can slide and power easily through the easy ice but of course must not hit the big stuff. It gets spicier at night, which is when Vladimir has his fun. The ship&#39;s large bridge (where the ship is steered) has great all-around views and is The Place To Be when one has a bit of time off, though the weather has been so good that many have bundled up a bit and tried watching icebreaking from the bow or other points outdoors on the ship.
